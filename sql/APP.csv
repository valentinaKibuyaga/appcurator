Six customizable alert modes allow you the flexibility to alert your friends, your campus police, local 911 or a combination of all three whenever you need them.  Here’s how it works: Need help right away?  Launch OnWatch™ and with just two taps, you are connected to local 911 or your campus police, and a customized message is sent to your pre-selected friends via text and email.  Sometimes your friends are the only people you need. With just two taps, you can send a customized message to your pre-selected friends, letting them know that you need help.  Going out for a run alone?  Set the timer feature. When the timer expires, you will receive an alert. If you don’t respond to the alert, a customized message will automatically go out to your pre-selected friends.  OnWatch™ includes your GPS location with all messages, so emergency services and your friends know where you are. And any time you activate OnWatch™, you can choose to have an alarm sound and a flashlight go off. You can even post your messages to Facebook and Twitter!  Please remember that continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life."
